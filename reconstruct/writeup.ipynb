    "To reduce the bigram cost into a unigram cost, and to allow further relaxation, we would want to reduce the edge cost for words. $ u(w) = \\min_{i} b(w_i, w) $ provides the lower bound of the bigram cost.\n",

    "2. For the relaxed problem, $h(s)$ is reflecting the minimal cost of picking a word as a successor, which is gauranteed to be less than the original cost $b(w', w)$. So we know the heuristic is constrained to the relaxed problem, thus it's consistent. The new future cost would be $\\sum u(w)$ which is less than the actual cost $\\sum b(w,w)$ due to the pick of min function.\n",
